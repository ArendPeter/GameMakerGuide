# Purchase on Udemy to view the full course

Sorry this page is only available if you buy the full course through Udemy

Once you buy the course, you'll have access to...

 * **All pages on www.guidetogamemaker.com!**
 * **All course videos on Udemy!**
 * **Downloadable Game Maker projects for the the main projects and the side projects!**

 [Click here](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4219462/?instructorPreviewMode=guest) to open Udemy and purchase the course!

 ## Unlocking guidetogamemaker.com

 Once you've purchased the course on Udemy, click the "Textbook Unlock" link under the resources on the first video

 > NOTE: The unlock link will only unlock the course on the current device. So if you, for example, wanted to read the textbook on both your computer and your phone, you'll need to open the unlock link from Udemy on both devices

 I'm excited to see you there!
