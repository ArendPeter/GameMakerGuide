# Platformer | Polish

The time has come to start wrapping up the course, so I want to focus on all the tricks you can use to make your game feel polish

There won't be a lot of functional changes to our game in this section, but we will take it from something that looks like it was made for a tutorial to something of professional quality. Afterall I want to give you the tools you need to make your games as good as possible (oh and I want good material for marketing the course, but that's a side note)

TODO: In addition to showing off how cool the new version looks, I also want to show the original w/o art
