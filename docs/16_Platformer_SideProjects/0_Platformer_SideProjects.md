# Side Projects

Time for some more projects for some more practice 😁. Since this was the final module, I'll throw in an extra project for some more options (and that puts the course at a nice even 10 😉)

## Runner

Now that you can make a platformer, try using that to make an auto-runner 🏃🏼‍♂️

In this genre, you're x increases at a constant speed, and the only button you need is the jump button (a lot like flappy bird come to think of it 🤔)

When you hit spikes, you die, when you hit the side of a wall, you die

I also added some parallax to spice it up a bit

Have fun 👋🏼!

## Shooter

Let's revisit our arcade roots, now that you've made a twin stick platformer, can you make a twin stick shooter?

This game has asteroids spawning from the edges of the screen, and spaceship which can move and shoot in different directions

When the asteroids get shot they should spawn a few smaller asteroids, and killing the smaller asteroids will earn you points

This was a personal favorite of mine, out of all the games I made for the course, this is the only one I had difficultly putting down. Good luck 🚀!

## Popper

Here we shoot balloons at other balloons, and if they match they pop! 🎈🎉

We need an arros which can aim/shoot balloons using the mouse, and we need the baloons to bounce off walls

The trickiest part will be getting the new balloons to interact properly when the collide with the pool of balloons. It's all possible with what you've learned so far, but that said it will require some outside the box thinking, so no shame in checking out the FAQs if you get stuck
