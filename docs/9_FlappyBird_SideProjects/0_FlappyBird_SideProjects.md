# Side Projects

We just finished making our second game togehter, great work! Now I'll give you another 2 side projects for practice ðŸ˜‰

## Jumper

![](../../images/flappy_bird/jumper.gif)

This game lets you jump from trampoline to trampoline to climb higher and higher

The room should be really tall, and the camera should follow the player

If the player reaches the top of the room, have the game go to the next level

To make things more challenging, include some spikes that follow the player, if the player hits these they lose a life and the level restarts

If the player runs out of lives the game restarts

## Explorer

![](../../images/flappy_bird/explorer.gif)

Here the player explorers a series of levels, and picks up a bunch of collectables along the way

The first level features a lock & key mechanic. There are yellow and red keys, and they open yellow and red doors respectively

The second level let's you find shoes to navigate different types of terrain. So to get through water, you need flippers, and to walk on ice, you need skates â›¸

On top of all that, there will be coins to collect ðŸ¤‘

And to switch things up, this game is on a grid, and you move 1 grid space at a time by pressing left/right/up/down

> **WARNING**: The wall collisions might be tricky, feel free to consult the FAQ
