# Side Projects

We just finished making our second game togehter, great work! Now I'll give you another 2 side projects for practice ðŸ˜‰

## Jumper

![](../../images/flappy_bird/jumper.gif)

This game lets you jump from trampoline to trampoline to climb higher and higher

The room should be really tall, and the camera should follow the player

If the player reaches the top of the room, have the game go to the next level

To make things more challenging, include some spikes that follow the player, if the player hits these they lose a life and the level restarts

If the player runs out of lives the game restarts
