# Side Projects

At the end of each game I'll give you some optional side projects as homework. These are chosen to compliment the new skills you picked up from the previous chapter

If you're having trouble, I give hints in the FAQ section, and you're also welcome to download my projects here (TODO: insert github link)

## Juggler

![](../../images/pong/juggler.gif)

The first side project is the juggler. A ball is falling, and you'll use your paddle to keep it up in the air as long as possible

Everytime the ball bounces your score increases, and when it goes offscreen it resets

I haven't shown you how to do gravity yet, you can try reading the documentation [here](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Instances/Instance_Variables/gravity.htm) when you're working on that part (there's also more details in the FAQ)
