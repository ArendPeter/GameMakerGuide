# Flappy Bird | Menus

In this section we'll be adding a bunch of menus

 * **Basic Intro**: We'll start a basic menu that just ask the player to press a button to start
 * **Adding Buttons**: Then we'll add a play button to the menu
 * **Level Select Menu**: Then we'll make a more complicated menu which allows for level select
