# Flappy Bird | Movement

The next game we'll make is a Flappy Bird clone üòÅ

![](../../images/pong/flappy_bird.gif)

## What we'll learn

Here are the big topics we'll cover for this game

 * **Scrolling Views**: We'll setup our window to only show a small portion of a much larger room
 * **Multiple Rooms**: We'll make multiple rooms, this will allow us to make multiple levels as well as menus
 * **UI**: We'll learn how to make interactable buttons

 Although for this chapter we'll just be handling the bird movement

 **But wait, don't we already know how to make things move?**, well, yes. In addition to teaching you new things, I'll also be RE-teaching you some other things and I want to explain why

## What we'll relearn

Game Maker gives you a lot of options for different ways to solve the same problem. DnD versus GML is the best example

**Sometimes, I opt to teach one and not the other**. For DnD versus GML, I opted to only teach you GML, and completely skip DnD. I want to give you what I have to offer, and DnD isn't part of that

Similarly, I opted not to teach you art, it's just not a skill that I'm equipped to teach you. I'm good at working with other talented people to make their art come to life, so that's what I'll teach you

**Othertimes, it's better to teach both**. Sometimes it's better to learn the easy way first, and then learn the better/harder way second rather than jumping straight into the hard way. Here are some examples from the previous chapters
 * ``hspeed``/``vspeed``/``direction``/``speed``: These are great for getting started, but think it's better to handle them from scratch, so we won't be used for the rest of the course
 * **Events**: We learned a ton of events in previous chapters, but I'm almost exclusively going to use the create, step, draw events moving forward

 So as a warning, a big chunk of this chapter is going to feel like duplicated effort, but rest assured, that it will set you up for bigger better things in the future üòâ

 ## TODO: add cheat sheets?
