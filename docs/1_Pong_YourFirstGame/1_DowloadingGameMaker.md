Before downloading game maker you'll first need to register for an account

1. In your browser navigate to https://yoyogames.com
1. Under the "GameMaker" dropdown select "Pricing"
1. Under the "Free" tier select "Start Now, It's Free!"
1. Continue registration process (setup account, verify email, etc.)

## Product Options

At the moment there are 4 categories of Game Maker products to choose from

* **Free**: This gives you access to all of Game Maker's features, and let's you test your games from Game Maker. But if you want to export the game and share it with your friends, then GXC is your only option for the free version
* **Creator**: Exports to Mac + Windows ( + everything from previous tiers )
* **Indie**:  Exports to Android + iOS exports ( + everything from previous tiers )
* **Enterprise**: Exports to everything GameMaker supports, including Playstation, XBox, and Switch

For this course, I recommend starting with **Free**, and then upgrade to one of the other tiers if you want to export to a specific platform

## Download
