## Camera Transitions

For our next trick let's try adding sliding camera transitions, [here's an example](https://youtu.be/mOTUVXrAOE8?t=166)

We're going to implement this by adding an ``in_transtion`` flag to ``oControl``. Then it can handle the transitioning and follow logic seperately. We'll also add invisible markers to the room. This will be check points where the camera won't cross them unless the player crosses them

First let make an ``oTransMarker`` object, give it the ``sTransMarker`` sprite, and then make it invisible

Then we got to add code. The complete code segment was so big I opted to break it down into separate snippets. Luckily we're near the end of the course, so I know you can handle it ðŸ˜‰

```
// oControl Create Event
left_bounds = 0;
right_bounds = room_width;
with(oTransMarker){
	if(x < other.right_bounds){
		other.right_bounds = x;
	}
}

is_transitioning = false;
trans_steps = room_speed;
trans_amt = 0;
trans_start_x = 0;
trans_target_x = 0;
```


``left_bounds`` / ``right_bounds``: This will be used in our clamping logic. Previously we clamped to be bounded by the room, meaning we clamped on the range ``0``, ``room_width``. With the markers involved, we need to update this depending on the marker position. ``left_bounds`` will be the ``x`` of the marker to the player's left (or ``0`` if there isn't one), and ``right_bounds`` will be the ``x`` of the marker to the player's right (or ``room_width`` if there isn't one)

``with(oTransMarker)``: I'm assuming the the player is starting at the left side of the room (to the left of all ``oTransMarker`` objects). So that means ``right_bounds`` should match the ``x`` of the left most ``oTransMarker`` (which would be the one directly to right of the player). Using ``with`` as a loop is a handy trick for finding the smallest x among the ``oTransMarker`` objects. Every time we find a smaller one we update ``right_bounds`` accordingly. Read over this carefully, since I'll be using a lot of similar ``with`` tricks in this section

``is_transitioning``: This represents whether we're curring in a sliding camera transition. This will complete alter our camera logic in the step event. The following ``trans_`` variables are all used during that transition

``trans_steps``: This is how many steps the transition will take

``trans_amt``: This is how far along we are in the transition. This will always start at 0 and end at 1

``trans_start_x`` / ``trans_target_x``: This is the start and ending x positions of the transition. Note that there's no y because we keep that constant during the transition

```
// oControl Step Event
if(is_transitioning){
	//// APPLY TRANSITION ALONG X
	trans_amt += 1 / trans_steps;
	cam_x(lerp(trans_start_x, trans_target_x, trans_amt));
	if(trans_amt >= 1){
		is_transitioning = false;
	}
}else{
	...
}
```

``if(is_transitioning){``: This ensures that we follow the new camera logic when we're in the middle of transition

``trans_amt += 1 / trans_steps;``: I want trans_amt to go from ``0`` to ``1`` over the course of ``trans_steps`` steps. If we do the math, that means we need to increase it by ``1 / trans_steps`` every step for that to work. To verify I can do ``trans_steps`` steps multiplied by ``1 / trans_steps`` per step, and I get ``1``. Perfect!

``cam_x(lerp(trans_start_x, trans_target_x, trans_amt));``: This is probaly the key line of this segment. We have our starting and endpoint points for the transition: ``trans_start_x`` and ``trans_target_x``, and then we want to transition between them using the ``trans_amt`` variable. It'll start at ``0``, meaning our cam_x will be set to ``trans_start_x``, but by the time ``trans_amt`` reaches 1, we'll be at ``trans_target_x``

>> **I thought lerp had an effect where it get's faster as it get's closer? Is that still happening?**: Ah, no it's not. In the original example, I had the amount locked at ``.1``, and the first number was getting closer to the target every frame. With the range getting smaller and smaller, than meant that the amount of the range was yielding a smaller number as well. This time it's different, the start / ending range remains the same for the entire transition. Also I'm increasing the amount by the same value every frame. So that results in the camera moving at a constant speed throughout the transition

``cam_y``: Note that we didn't have any logic for cam_y. We'll just leave that untouced during this transition

``if(trans_amt > 1){``: This means we've reached the end of the transition, and when this happens we're ready to move back to the normal operations

```
// oControl Step Event
if(is_transitioning){
	...
}else{
	//// CENTER ON PLAYER
	//// SMOOTH CAMERA
	//// CLAMP TO BOUNDS
	cam_x = clamp(cam_x, left_bounds + max_shake_dist, right_bounds-cam_w()-max_shake_dist);
	cam_y = clamp(cam_y, max_shake_dist, room_height-cam_h()-max_shake_dist);

	//// CAMERA SHAKE
	//// APPLY

	//// TRIGGER TRANSITION TO THE RIGHT
	if(oPlayer.x > right_bounds){
		// update bounds
		left_bounds = right_bounds;
		right_bounds = room_width;
		with(oTransMarker){
			if(other.left_bounds < x and x < other.right_bounds){
				other.right_bounds = x;
			}
		}

		// update trans variables
		is_transitioning = true;
		trans_amt = 0;
		trans_start_x = cam_x();
		trans_target_x = left_bounds + max_shake_dist;
	}

	//// TRIGGER TRANSITION TO THE LEFT
	// TODO
}
```

``clamp(cam_x, left_bounds + max_shake_dist, right_bounds-cam_w()-max_shake_dist);``: For this I used to have ``0`` and ``room_width``, but now that we have markers the bounds could be any value, so replaced those with ``left_bounds`` and ``right_bounds`` respectively

``oPlayer.x < left_bounds``: When the player has moved to the left of the camera, that means we're ready to slide the camera to the left

``right_bounds = left_bounds;``: When the camera's done moving, the right side of the view should align with the same marker that's currently on the left side. So we set ``right_bounds`` equal to ``left_bounds``

``left_bounds = 0;``: The camera is about to move left, but we don't know if there's a new marker further left to be a new bound. So I'll start off with 0 by defeault and then we'll increase it if we find new ones

``with(oTransMarker)``: Here we have another ``with()`` loop which is trying to find the largest marker. In this case we start with a range (0, ``right_bounds``), and everytime we find a marker within that range, we update the ``left_bound``. This way we'll have the right most marker within the range by the time we're done, and the ``left_bounds`` and ``right_bounds`` values should correspond to consecutive

``is_transitioning = true;``: This will make the next step follow the transition logic instead of the player following logic

``trans_amt`` / ``trans_start_x`` / ``trans_target_x``: These variables set us up to be used with ``lerp()`` later. ``trans_target_x`` is the most involved. When we go back to to player following mode and we apply the ``clamp`` function, we don't want the view to clamp abruptly. So since the clamp logic has ``left_bounds + max_shake_dist`` set to the minimum, we're going to use that as the transition target before we go back into following mode

When you place a few markers in the room and test it out, we should see the screen shifting when the player walks by the invisible markers. Awesome!

``TODO``: But what about the left side?

<details data-summary="How to implement TRIGGER TRANSITION TO THE RIGHT?" markdown="1">
We can largely copy and paste, but with a few critical differences

```
////TRIGGER TRANSITION TO THE LEFT

if(oPlayer.x < left_bounds){
	// update bounds
	right_bounds = left_bounds;
	left_bounds = 0;
	with(oTransMarker){
		if(other.left_bounds < x and x < other.right_bounds){
			other.left_bounds = x;
		}
	}

	// update trans variables
	is_transitioning = true;
	trans_amt = 0;
	trans_start_x = cam_x();
	trans_target_x = right_bounds - max_shake_dist - cam_w();
}
```

``if(oPlayer.x < left_bounds)``: This time we trigger when the player exits to theleft

``other.left_bounds = x;``: When we loop through the trans markers, we're looking for a new left bound this time, so we update this line accordingly

``trans_target_x = right_bounds - max_shake_dist - cam_w();``: Since we're moving to the left, I have to make the ``target_trans_x`` match the maximum in our clampinglogic
</details>

Yay! Now we can do both ðŸŽ‰

## Camera Transition Tweaks

After playing with it a little bit, you may want a few more tweaks. For example, it's kind of annoying when you get shot by missiles from across the room. To fix this let's disable shooting on the missile object when we're in a different area

```
// oMissileTurret Alarm 1 event
alarm[1] = random_range(3*room_speed, 5*room_speed);

if(x < oControl.left_bounds or x > oControl.right_bounds) exit;

...
```

Next I also want to update the player. When we're mid transition I don't think we should be able to move. This is a good opportunity to practice adding another state to the state machine. Want to give it a try?

<details data-summary="How to add a in_transition state to the player's state machine?" markdown="1">

```
// oPlayer Create Event
enum PLAYER_STATE{
	in_control,
	hurt,
	dying,
	in_transition,
}

// oPlayer Step Event
switch(state){
case PLAYER_STATE.in_transition:
	if(not oControl.in_transition){
		state = PLAYER_STATE.in_control;
	}
	break;
case PLAYER_STATE.hurt:
case PLAYER_STATE.dying:
	// do nothing
	break;
case PLAYER_STATE.in_control:
	//// HORIZONTAL
	//// VERTICAL
	//// SHOOTING
	//// TRIGGER IN_TRANSITION STATE
	if(oControl.in_transition){
		state = PLAYER_STATE.in_transition;
	}
	break;
default:
	print("STATE NOT HANDLED", state);
}

// oPlayer Draw Event
switch(state){
case PLAYER_STATE.dying:
	//// DEATH
	break;
case PLAYER_STATE.in_transition:
case PLAYER_STATE.hurt:
case PLAYER_STATE.in_control:
	//// SET COLOR
	//// ARMS
	//// RESET COLOR
	break;
default:
	print("STATE NOT HANDLED", state);
}
```

Disabling the player could have been done in one line, but the nice thing about adding it to a stateis that we need to think through all cases

**When should the player enter the in_transition state?**: Only while the player is in the in_control state, otherwise we might be canceling a death animation

**How should the in_transition state be drawn?**: Like the non-death state, w/ arms and all

**How should the in_transition state animate?**: We shouldn't need to update this, that can follow all the same rules and treat it like an idle scenario

**Whic state should we enter when we exit in_transition?**: definitly in_control. hurt or dying wouldn't make any sense
