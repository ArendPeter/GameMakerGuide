# Creating a new Game Maker Studio Project

This step will go into creating a new project, Drag and Drop versus Code, as well as some of the basics about Game Maker's interface and it's resources

To start, name your project ``Pong``, and select **Code** as the project type.

## Drag and Drop versus Code

To start create a new project called ``Pong``. The first decision you'll need to make is whether to use Drag and Drop, or Code. Here's the difference

* **Drag and Drop (DnD)** : This simplifies Game Maker's interface, allowing you to create your soling through dragging and dropping blocks, and connecting them to form your logic. Using DnD you can develop your games without ever writing a line of code, however you still have the option insert code snippets if you want
* **Code** : If you prefer writing code, this option will remove all the DnD windows, and replace them with text editors. Game Maker uses Game Maker Language, which is loosely similar to writing Javascript

For my courses we'll be choosing **Code**. DnD is definitely easier to learn if you're trying to pick it up on your own, but Code is also perfectly fine to start with if you're being guided through it. I prefer coding, and for the course I felt it would be smoother for your to start with Code rather than switch to DnD to Code later and relearn the basics.

But don't get me wrong, DnD and similar node based game development tools are still very powerful, and there are many people who make great games without writing code. So I hope you can follow along and find that working with code isn't as bad as it seems, but if it doesn't click with you, there's also no shame in using DnD

Here's the official series on DnD

Here are some game devs who make their games w/o using code at all (They use Unity and Unreal, please contact me if you know of Game Maker examples I can add here)
