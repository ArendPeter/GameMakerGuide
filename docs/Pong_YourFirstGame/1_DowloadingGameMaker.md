## Product Options

At the moment there are 4 categories of Game Maker products to choose from

* **Free Trial**: 30 Trial, this includes full Game Maker functionality, except you won't be able to create executables (so your friends won't be able to play your games unless they also have game maker)
* **Desktop**: Export executables for Mac or Windows
* **Developer**: Export executables for Desktop (which combines windows, mac, and ubuntu), Web, UWP, or Mobile (which includes android and iOS)
* **Console**: Export executables for Playstation, Xbox, or Switch. This also has an option for Ultimate edition, which includes all platforms

For this course, I recommend starting with **Free Trial**, and then, if you're interested, purchasing one of the **Desktop** options when your trial ends. From there you can expand further if you're interested in making a game for a particular platform.
