# Flappy Bird | Cameras and Rooms

This section will focus on views and rooms

**Cameras**: Setting up a camera will allow our window to only show a small section of the room, and we can also setup the view to follow the player
**Rooms**: Multiple rooms will make it easier to have many distinct areas. In particular we'll be adding a menu, as well as multiple levels
