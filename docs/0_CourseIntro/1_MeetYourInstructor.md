# Meet Your Instructor

Hi I'm Arend Peter!

![](../../images/selfie.png)

I'm an ex-Amazon Software Engineer, who's currently a full time indie game developer as well as a Game Maker instructor

Game Maker was my first experience with programming, and I've been using and teaching Game Maker now for <span id="years-of-game-maker"></span> years

In that time, I've helped release several major titles to pc and mobile using Game Maker, and they've all received some combination of awards and features

> Feel free to check out stargardengames.com to see the rest of the projects me and by buddies are working on

I also have experience tutoring math and computer science, and I've got over 200 Game Maker tutorials on YouTube (see [ArendPeterTeaches](https://www.youtube.com/user/SynforgeTutorials) and [SynforgeGames](https://www.youtube.com/user/SynforgeGames) although most of them are old and cringy ðŸ˜«)

I'm currently living in Los Angeles with my lovely wife (and soon to be [hollywood star](https://www.yenahan.com/)) Yena Jean Han, as well as our spicy cat Kimchi (he has an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/the.kimchi.kitty/)!)
