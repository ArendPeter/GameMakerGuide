# How to follow the course

So this course exists in video form, as well as text form, and you can mix and match however you want, depending on your learning style. Here are some things to note when reading the text

## Syntax

Any code snippets will be highlighted ``like this`` and programming concepts and/or glossary terms **like this**

I'll also include larger code snippets like this

```
// oPlayer Step Event

...

if(keyboard_check(vk_left)){
    x -= 4;
}
```

Once you're comfortable with events, I'll start each of my code snippets with a comment stating where you can find the code

If the there's preexisting code in the event I'll either include it in the snippet, or use ``...`` to indicate that the code is still there, it's just not relevant to the update

## ðŸ¤“ Deep dives

Since this I've been programming and making games for a long time, I'll frequently want to go on tangents digging into some of the finer details of what I've discussed

Generally as an instructor, I would be afraid to lose people in the way, especially if some students are already having a hard time with the more critical concepts. So I won't include those tangents for videos, except maybe as an occasional optional video

But text is a different story, it's a lot easier for people to skip over sections on text. So I'm marking the deep dives with a ðŸ¤“, so you know to either skip or buckle up

## Pop Quizes

I like how Udemy gives me the option to supply quizes. They can keep people thinking and enaged, and can also serve as checkpoints so people know if they *really* understand the concept or not

So to simulate that I'll be including expandable areas in the text book. Like this

<details data-summary="What does ðŸ¤“ mean in the text book?" markdown="1">

It means I'm about to go into a deep dive on the tangential topic, but you should only read these blurbs if they're interesting to you. If you're not in the mood please skip ðŸ™‚

(See what I did there, I did a meta thing ðŸ˜‰)

</details>

With each of these expandable areas, I recomend you pause to think about the question for a bit before checking the answer
