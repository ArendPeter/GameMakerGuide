# Course Intro

Here's an overview of the course

## What We'll Make

We'll be making 3 games together, and I'll walk you through every detail

First we'll get all our Game Maker fundamentals down by making Pong

Second we'll learn to about levels, menus, and win states, by making a Flappy Bird Clone

Lastly we'll put together a polished platformer together, complete with screen shake, and epic flame particles

## What You'll Make

More importantly, I want to talk about what you'll make. I believe you learn best when you're trying to solve problems and make games on your own. So I'll be including some programming quizes along the way, as well as assignments to full games on your own (each up carefully scoped to be possible with your skills at the time)

After the we learn Pong, you can try making Ping Pong Juggle and Break Out on your own

Then once we've made Flappy Bird, you can try making Doodle Jump, and Chip's Challenge on your own

Then finally once we've made a polished platformer together, you can try making Geometry Dash style auto-runner, an asteroid style shooting game shooting game with waves of enemies, and another shooting game where you aim at baloons and try to get combos

I've created demos for all 10 of these games (either downloadable or in browser), head over to our itch page to play them

## What if you get stuck?

I want your experience learning game development to be as smooth and fun as possible. So I will be actively monitoring any questions asked on Udemy

You can ask questions on our Discord. On Discord you can get help from me, as well as many of the other students taking the course

As I get more feedback I will be updating the text book as well as Udemy to make it smoother for the next students

## What next

The first chapter, **Pong \| Your First Game**, is available for free on Udemy, as well as in text form. If you like it, you can buy the full course (Udemy will frequently have sales to save you money!), and you'll get all the Udemy videos, as well as the full text book

Hope to see you there!
