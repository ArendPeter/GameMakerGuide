# Course Intro

Hi, welcome to the Arend Peter Teaches Game Maker course

## What is this

This website serves as the text book for my video based course on Udemy. So you can use it as a reference while following the videos, or, if you prefer reading, you can skip the videos, and just follow along with the book

The course will go over all the basics of Game Maker, here's some of the skills you'll learn by the end

 * **Work with Game Maker resources**: In particular sprites, objects, rooms, fonts, sounds, and tile sets will all be included
 * **Basic GML programming**: Game Maker has it's own programming language, and you'll know how to work with the 50 most common variables and functions
 * **End-to-end games**: Setup your game end to end, including multiple levels, as well as a menu, and a win state
 * **Game Polish**: I've released multiple sucessful titles with Game Maker along w/ my friends at star garden games. I'll show you the tricks that go into making your games look professional and polished
 * **Software Principles**: I used to work as a full time software engineer. I pass some of that experience on so that you can write clean code that's easy to update, and easy to scale as your game grows

## What We'll Make

We'll be making 3 games together, and I'll walk you through every detail

First we'll get all our Game Maker fundamentals down by making Pong

Second we'll learn to about levels, menus, and win states, by making a Flappy Bird Clone

Lastly we'll put together a polished platformer together, complete with screen shake, and epic flame particles

## What You'll Make

More importantly, I want to talk about what you'll make. I believe you learn best when you're trying to solve problems and make games on your own. So I'll be including some programming quizes along the way, as well as assignments to full games on your own (each up carefully scoped to be possible with your skills at the time)

After the we learn Pong, you can try making Ping Pong Juggle and Break Out on your own

Then once we've made Flappy Bird, you can try making Doodle Jump, and Chip's Challenge on your own

Then finally once we've made a polish platformer together, you can try making Geometry Dash style auto-runner, and a top down shooting game with waves of enemies

I've created demos for all 9 of these games (either downloadable or in browser), head over to our itch page to play them

## What if you get stuck?

I want your experience learning game development to be as smooth and fun as possible. So I will be actively monitoring any questions asked on Udemy

You can ask questions on our Discord. On Discord you can get help from me, as well as many of the other students taking the course

As I get more feedback I will be updating the text book as well as Udemy to make it smoother for the next students

## What next

The first chapter, **Pong \| Your First Game**, is available for free on Udemy, as well as in text form. If you like it, you can buy the full course (Udemy will frequently have sales to save you money!), and you'll get all the Udemy videos, as well as the full text book

Hope to see you there!
