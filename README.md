Hi, and welcome to guidetogamemaker.com!

This guide will take you from NO EXPERIENCE, to making up to 10 games using Game Maker Studio 2

I'm Arend Peter, an ex-Amazon software engineer turned indie game dev, and I've been using Game Maker for over <span id="years-of-game-maker"></span> years

Here's what makes this course different from other courses you'll find on the internet
 * **Text and Video**: Available in both text and video form (access the video, by enrolling on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4219462/?instructorPreviewMode=guest))
 * **Independent Projects**: I'll walk through 3 projects step-by-step, but I'll also provide 7 side projects for you to make on your own. These side projects are specifically chosen to reinforce your skills in the main projects, and to make sure that they stick when you're making your own games. I'll also provide source code and FAQ pages in case you get stuck
 * **Professional Experience**: I have professional experience as an Amazon software engineer, and I've released many hit games with my friends at [Star Garden Games](https://stargardengames.com/). When you follow the course, you'll get the benefits of both, as I show you how to make polished games using software best practices

You can access the full text based course, as well as the video, when you enroll on Udemy. [Click here](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4219462/?instructorPreviewMode=guest) to open Udemy and Entroll!
